# obfuscatedPoetry
This repository is a final project for ENGL 215: Text and Code. 

## Idea 
Words are symbols, that is, a word itself is nothing but a pointer. It seems that we can agree on a common pointer (the word) but we can never agree on what is actually referenced by that pointer because our own instantiation of that thing is dependant on our experiences and we each have different experiences.

## Execution
The poems featured here are originals written by Mike Lanzafame. The images are also his original illustrations. We identified key words in the poem and intentionally blurred them to draw attention to the ambiguity involved in resolving the meaning of a word. We've added an array of illustrations mapped to each word to demonstrate the different possibilites that could fit into each word, and how it changes the poem overall depending on which one you draw.

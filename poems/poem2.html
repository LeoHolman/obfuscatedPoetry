'There's something here with me,'
he whispered, afraid -
A shape in the darkness,
the shadow it made.
It moved in the silence -
it turned in the night -
It crawled and it crept
in a flicker of light.

It came from seclusion -
it slipped throgh the trees -
A voice in the gloaming,
a sound on the breeze -
A crowding of creatures,
he saw with dismay.

He hid on the ground till they all went away.

'Good heavens!' he cried with a tremor of dread -
'My house is ablaze, and I'm needed!' he said.
'My God!' I responded with pity and woe:
'Don't dally or dawdle - get going and go!'

'Be careful,' I spoke, and he nodded in fear -
He whispered his thanks and he wiped at a tear -
And there, in the midst of a red flashing light,
He quickly departed in pain and in plight.

I drove to see his home on the following dawn -
And saw him relaxing in a pool on the lawn.

His house wasn't damaged.
At night I returned.
I walked in silence and watched as it burned.

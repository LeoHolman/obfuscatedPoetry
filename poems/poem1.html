I woke alone at night in chains
Of shining steel and weighted rings
That hung from high in swollen veins,
Or twist and caght like tattered wings.

I knew the smell - the stench of death
That rose and grew as vision blurred
With every painful, broken breath,
Until - at last - a shadow stirred.

It stretched a pointed, stunted limb
That held a sharpened shape. A sigh.
A sound. A voice. A whisper, grim:
'You'll cross your heart and hope to die...'

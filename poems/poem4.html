When the midnight moon is gleaming,
And the night is mine to keep -
When I'm drifting and I'm dreaming
In the seconds next to sleep -
Then I let my thoughts a-wander
Through the secret rooms behind -
And the places where I ponder,
In the spaces of my mind.

I will dream about the ocean,
Where the waves are waving free -
In the endless swell of motion
On an ever-moving sea -
And I'll think abot the glimmer
Of the shining in the stars -
On a ship to see the shimmer
From the rusty dust of Mars.

I will dream about the never -
I will dream about the all -
I will dream about forever,
And through fancy I will fall.
I will dream about the clearing,
And I'll dream about the day -
And when all my dreams are nearing,
I will dream...

... and drift away.

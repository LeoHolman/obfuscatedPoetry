You sense it before you can see it ahead -
A shape in the shadows, a shade of the dead -
And down in the darkness, in silence it stands -
Its fingers moving and curl in its hands...

You think of the ways that you wandered alone -
The hopes and the wishes you wished for your own -
The worries unspoken that broke you apart -
The dreams when you sleep that you keep in your heart...

And so it's before you.
You're facing the black.
You stare at the dark,
and the dark's looking back.
Its fingers are curling.
Your fingers are numb.
You turn from the darkness.

Your time hasn't come.

Crawling, writhing, clawing, creeping,
Scraping walls in whispered weeping,
Ragged breathing,
narrowed spaces,
Broken edges,
choking places.

Caught and captured, clutching, clasping,
Bloody hands with fingers grasping,
Painful panting,
aching, wheezing,
Rising waters,
strangle, squeezing.

On and on and on you're crawling,
Sinking, drowning, flailing, falling,
Failing, gaining nothing, never.

Every second lasts forever.
